## How are graceful degradation and service workers related?:

Service workers are a tool that can promote graceful degradation. They provide a fall back option for users with little to no internet connection. They keep the integrity of the webpage's structure in conditions that are worse than expected, meaning the page wont immediatly fail under less than ideal circumstances. In addition, they can help reduce resource usage. Again, this allows for users, working in poor conditions, to continue to have access to the webpage in a useable state.
